/*
 * This OpMode illustrates the basics of AprilTag recognition and pose estimation,
 * including Java Builder structures for specifying Vision parameters.
 *
 * For an introduction to AprilTags, see the FTC-DOCS link below:
 * https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/en/latest/apriltag/vision_portal/apriltag_intro/apriltag-intro.html
 *
 * In this sample, any visible tag ID will be detected and displayed, but only tags that are included in the default
 * "TagLibrary" will have their position and orientation information displayed.  This default TagLibrary contains
 * the current Season's AprilTags and a small set of "test Tags" in the high number range.
 *
 * When an AprilTag in the TagLibrary is detected, the SDK provides location and orientation of the tag, relative to the camera.
 * This information is provided in the "ftcPose" member of the returned "detection", and is explained in the ftc-docs page linked below.
 * https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/apriltag-detection-values
 *
 * To experiment with using AprilTags to navigate, try out these two driving samples:
 * RobotAutoDriveToAprilTagOmni and RobotAutoDriveToAprilTagTank
 *
 * There are many "default" VisionPortal and AprilTag configuration parameters that may be overridden if desired.
 * These default parameters are shown as comments in the code below.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list.
